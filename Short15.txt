Do you know why the area of this triangle cannot be 20.
But since childhood we learnt that area is half base height which comes out to be 20 in this case.

Let's dive a bit deeper into this problem, 
Let the two sides of the triangle be A and B, as this is a right angled triangle we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write A^2 + B^2 = 8^2 which is equal to 64

Now lets use AM-GM inequality for A^2 and B^2 and we find out the max value of AB would be 32.
Area of the triangle is half of it, that is 16.

Thus area cannot be 20. Now what is wrong with the information given.

It's just an extra information that spoils the problem.
If we construct a circle with the base as diameter then all the triangles with the third vertex on the arc will be a right angled triangle and the maximum height that's possible will be equal to the radius. Thus a right angle at the third vertex is not possible with the height of the triangle being 5.

  Do you know why the area of this triangle <emphasis level="moderate">cannot</emphasis> be 20?  
  <break time="400ms"/>
  
  But wait… we know that area is half of base times height and if the base is 8 and height is 5, shouldn't that give 20?  
  <break time="600ms"/>
  
  Let’s dive a bit deeper.  
  <break time="400ms"/>
  
  Suppose the two perpendicular sides of the triangle are <say-as interpret-as="characters">A</say-as> and <say-as interpret-as="characters">B</say-as>.  
  Using the Pythagorean Theorem,  
  <say-as interpret-as="characters">A</say-as> squared plus <say-as interpret-as="characters">B</say-as> squared equals 8 squared — that is 64.  

  
  Now, we use the <emphasis level="moderate">AM-GM Inequality</emphasis> on <say-as interpret-as="characters">A</say-as> squared and <say-as interpret-as="characters">B</say-as> squared,  
  and we find that the <emphasis level="moderate">maximum value</emphasis> of <say-as interpret-as="characters">AB</say-as> is 32. That makes the <emphasis level="moderate">maximum possible area</emphasis> of the triangle 16.
  
  So, the area can <emphasis level="strong">never</emphasis> be 20.  
  <break time="400ms"/>
  
  Now what’s wrong here?  
  <break time="400ms"/>
    
  If we draw a circle with the base as the diameter, then any triangle formed  
  with the third point on the arc will be a right-angled triangle.  
  <break time="400ms"/>
  
  And in this setup, the <emphasis level="moderate">maximum possible height</emphasis> is the <emphasis level="moderate">radius</emphasis> of the circle — which is 4.  
  <break time="500ms"/>
  
  So that value of 5 just breaks the rules of geometry.
