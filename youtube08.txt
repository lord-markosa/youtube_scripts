In this problem we are given a quarter circle and a small circle inside it, which touches the quarter circle.
Now we are given a chord of the outer circle which touches the inner circle and whose length is 12.
We need to find the area of the yellow region.

When a little known is given in a problem we should always write the expression of what we need to find.

Let's assume the Radius of the outer circle is capital R and the radius of the inner circle is small R.
Now the area would be pi times capital R^2 over 4 minus pi times small R^2
Which can we simplified further.

Let's construct the line as shown and look at the triangle OAB

We can use the Pythagoras theorem here to write this...

Now we know that OA = capital R, OB = twice small R and AB is 12 given in the problem statement.

Substituting the value we obtain capital R^2 minus 4 small R^2 = 12^2.

Have we seen this somewhere?
Yes we have... its the only unknown that we need to determine the area of the required region

So the area is going to be 36 pi.
