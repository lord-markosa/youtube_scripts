More than 90% of the people made the same mistake in this problem. (change this hook)

The answer would have been none of these if we were asked to factorize x^2 + 1 which equals (x+2i) times (x minus 2i)
But is it same for x^4 + 4?

Well it turns out to be no

we can actually factorize x^4 + 4 by adding and subtracting 4x^2
the first three terms is nothing but the square of (x^2 + 2) and the forth term is square of 2x
Thus we get something of the form A^2 - B^2 which can be factorized as shown...
And look we have x^2 + 2x + 2 in option C.

  This question <emphasis level="moderate">looks easy</emphasis> — until it <emphasis level="strong">isn’t</emphasis>.
  Over <say-as interpret-as="number">90</say-as> percent of people fall into the same trap.

  We’re asked to factorize:
  <emphasis level="moderate">x^4 + 4</emphasis>
  <break time="400ms"/>
  
  If we were asked to factorize x^2 + 4, then the answer would be:
  (x + 2i) times (x minus 2i)

  But here’s the catch:
  <emphasis level="moderate">x^2+4</emphasis> is different
  <break time="600ms"/>
  
  Let’s try something clever.
  <break time="200ms"/>
  We <emphasis>add and subtract</emphasis> 4x^2
  <break time="400ms"/>
  
  Now, this is nothing but (x^2 + 2)^2 square
  <break time="300ms"/>
  
  And the last term?
  That’s 2x squared
  <break time="300ms"/>
  
  Now it’s of the form:
  <emphasis>A squared minus B squared</emphasis>
  <break time="300ms"/>
  which factors as (A minus B) times (A plus B)
  <break time="500ms"/>
  
  So we write:
  <break time="200ms"/>
  (x^2 minus 2x + 2) times (x^2 + 2x + 2)
  <break time="300ms"/>
  

  And look!
  <break time="200ms"/>
  Option C contains this.
