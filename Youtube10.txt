Hey Everyone!

In this problem we are given a triangle ABC such that angle A = 48 degrees. X is a point on the base such that BX equals AC and angle ACX = 18 degrees. Now, we are asked to find out the value of angle B.

These kind of problems mostly revolve around a crucial construction, once that is figured out everything becomes easy peazy.
Specific to this problem or problems with similar patter we need to construct a line such that BC is a part of an isosceles triangle and can work out our way through the result we obtain.

We will understand more when we solve this problem.

Here, lets construct a line BP such that P lies on CX and BX equals BP. Now, it might be the case that P lies outside triangle ABC when we extend CX, in that case the proof would again follow similar path.

For now, let's go ahead with this.

Consider the triangle PBX.

the angle PXB can be obtained as the sum of the two opposite interior angles ACX and CAX which would be 66 degrees.

Since the two sides of triangle PBX is equal it's an isosceles triangle, which means angle XPB would be 66 degrees as well.

This implies angle PBX equals 48 degrees.

Wait a minute!!

This means if we extend the line BP to meet AC at C it will form an isosceles triangle ZAB since the angles on the base AB are both 48 degrees. 

This seems like a mismatch...
Doesn't it?

Let's find out.

We can write AZ = BZ

AZ can be written as AC - CZ and BZ can be written as BP plus PZ. PZ and ZC are the lines marked in red.

Thus we can write the following.

Now, AC = BX = BP.

This means that the sum of CZ + PZ  = 0. That's interesting because both these are lengths which are non-negative quantities.
This relation holds true only when CZ = PZ = 0.
This implies Z P and C all these coincides and thus angle CBA would be same as angle PBX that is 48 degrees. Thus x is nothing but 48 degrees.

  Hey everyone!

  We’re given a triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">ABC</say-as> with angle A equals 48 degrees.  
  There’s a point X on the base such that <say-as interpret-as="characters">BX</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">AC</say-as>,  
  and angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">ACX</say-as> is 18 degrees.  
  We need to find the value of angle B.

  Now, this kind of geometry problem usually hinges on a clever construction.  
  Once that’s cracked, the rest becomes easy peasy.

  In problems like this, we often try to form an isosceles triangle using line segments —  
  and that's exactly what we’ll do.

  Let’s draw a line <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as>, such that P lies on line <say-as interpret-as="characters">CX</say-as>,  
  and <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">BX</say-as>.  
  It’s possible that point P lies outside triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">ABC</say-as> —  
  no worries, the logic still works.

  Now, focus on triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">PBX</say-as>.

  Angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">PXB</say-as> is the sum of angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">ACX</say-as> and angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">CAX</say-as>,  
  that’s 18 plus 48, which gives us 66 degrees.

  Since <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">BX</say-as>, triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">PBX</say-as> is isosceles.  
  So, angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">XPB</say-as> is also 66 degrees.  
  That means angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">PBX</say-as> is 48 degrees.

  Wait a second...

  That’s the same as angle A!

  Now, if we extend <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as> to meet <say-as interpret-as="characters">AC</say-as> at a point Z,  
  then triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">ZAB</say-as> becomes isosceles,  
  with both base angles equal to 48 degrees.

  Looks a bit suspicious, doesn’t it?

  Let’s verify.

  We can say <say-as interpret-as="characters">AZ</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">BZ</say-as>.

  Now, <say-as interpret-as="characters">AZ</say-as> is <say-as interpret-as="characters">AC</say-as> minus <say-as interpret-as="characters">CZ</say-as>,  
  and <say-as interpret-as="characters">BZ</say-as> is <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as> plus <say-as interpret-as="characters">PZ</say-as>.

  So we get:  
  <say-as interpret-as="characters">AC</say-as> minus <say-as interpret-as="characters">CZ</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as> plus <say-as interpret-as="characters">PZ</say-as>.

  But since <say-as interpret-as="characters">AC</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">BX</say-as> and <say-as interpret-as="characters">BP</say-as> are equal,  
  that means <say-as interpret-as="characters">CZ</say-as> plus <say-as interpret-as="characters">PZ</say-as> equals zero.

  Which can only happen if both <say-as interpret-as="characters">CZ</say-as> and <say-as interpret-as="characters">PZ</say-as> are zero —  
  meaning points C, Z, and P are the same!

  So finally, angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">CBA</say-as> equals angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">PBX</say-as>,  
  which is 48 degrees.

  And that’s our answer!

corrections:

The sum of opposite interior angles of the triangle equals the exterior angle.

Using the properties of isosceles triangle.

That is all the line segments marked with double dashes are equal.

The quantities marked in red when subtracted and added to the sides AC and BP results in AZ and BZ respectively.
