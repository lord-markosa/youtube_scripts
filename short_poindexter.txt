Why did Daredevil slam Poindexter's face into the table when he asked for help escaping prison?

Poindexter is daredevil's arch nemesis who killed his friend foggy.

It wasn’t just rage. It was the plan.

That brutal hit broke one of Poindexter’s teeth… and that broken tooth became his weapon.

He aimed it straight into the guard's eye who was supposed to restrain him.

Poindexter — a master of aim — didn’t miss.

He took the guard’s uniform, grabbed his ID… and got into the prison guards' bus and broke out of prison.

Daredevil didn’t give him freedom… he gave him the chance to take it.

But why did Daredevil help him escape?

Poindexter was not acting by himself and Daredevil wanted to find out the people behind this.
