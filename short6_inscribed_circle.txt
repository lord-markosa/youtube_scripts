This type of question looks really scary but is rather simple if you use this one trick.

The inscribed triangle touches all the 3 triangles and we need to find its radius.

We need to connect the centers by constructing lines.

Let P be the center of the circle on AC, and N be the center of the inscribed circle.
Lets draw the triangle NCP (which is a right angled triangle).

Now can we determine the sides of this triangle?
The answer is "YES!".

NP will be the sum of radius of these 2 triangles. That's r + 6.
CN will be the difference of radius of the outer triangle and the inscribed triangle. That's 12 - r
PC will be nothing but the radius of the circle on AC. That's 6

Now we can use Pythagoras theorem to write the following equation.
On solving this we can get r = 4. So, its option B.
