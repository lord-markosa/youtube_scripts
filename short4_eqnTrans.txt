90% of the students take more than 15 seconds to answer this question
First get the coefficients and root relationship
obtain coefficients for the new root and substitute
sum of the roots is going to be minus b by c
product is going to be a by c

Lets focus on the changed roots.
We observe a pattern. The new roots are of the form 1 over x where x is the old root.
Let y be 1 over x which implies x is 1 over y.
Lets put it in place of x in the equation. Thus we get a new equation in terms of y where y is 1 over x.
Lets replace y with x. 
There you go.
Its option C.
