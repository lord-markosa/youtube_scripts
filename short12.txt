In this problem we are given just one equation on x and y. Most people are tempted to choose option D.
It would be correct if we were asked to find the value of x or y.
But we are asked to find the value of this expression.
After simplifying the exponential expression... we obtain this.
And look this is what is given by the equation in x and y.
Thus the answer is option C

    In this problem, we're given just one equation in x and y. <break time="300ms"/>	

    And while it might seem like not enough information... <break time="300ms"/>

    we're not being asked to find x or y directly. <break time="300ms"/>

    We're asked to find the value of this expression. <break time="400ms"/>

Now, 625 = 25^2 or 5^4
Thus we can simplify the exponential expression... <break time="400ms"/>

    And look — this matches exactly what’s already given in the equation. <break time="400ms"/>

    So the answer is actually <emphasis>Option C</emphasis>. <break time="400ms"/>

        to obtain 5 raised to the power x minus 4y
