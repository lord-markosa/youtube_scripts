These two women were about to do something that no one ever attempted.

Both being pro-climbers decided to get to the top of this 2000 foot high decommissioned TV tower in the desert.

After reaching the top, just when they were about to descent the ladder broke down and they lost the bag containing essentials which got stuck on this satellite dish far below.

There was no signal at that height.

They came up with a plan to prep a message and drop the phone stuffing it inside a shoe for cushioning. But that plan didn't work out.

Hunter thought she could climb down and get the bag pack from the antenna with the rope she had. But the rope was short by a few meters.

She unhooked her and jumped on the antenna and got the bag then attached it to the rope. 
She then jumped to get catch the rope. She started climbing the rope and was about to get hold of the ladder, her leg slips. Then Becky pulls her up. 

Becky later realized that she was hallucinating Hunter the whole time, as she couldn't make it back after she slipped. Becky just pulled the bag up.

After being tired and exhausted Becky gathers some courage, she climbs down to the satellite puts the Phone in hunter's shoe and stuffs it in her body and throws her down.

The messages are sent. Becky gets rescued the same night.

These two pro climbers set out to do the impossible — climb a 2000-foot abandoned TV tower in the middle of the desert.

They made it to the top. But as they prepared to descend... the ladder broke.

No signal at that height... No supplies. Their backpack was stuck far below on a satellite dish.

They tried dropping a phone cushioned in a shoe with a prepped message — it failed.

Hunter risked everything, climbed down to the satellite, jumped on the dish, and got the bag, but as she tried to climb back, she slipped. 

Then Becky pulls her up. She thought she saved her... until she realized — Hunter never made it. She was hallucinating. Her body was on the dish below.

Alone and desperate, Becky made one final move.

She climbed down to the satellite dish, placed the phone in Hunter’s shoe, stuffed it in her body and dropped it.

The messages were sent. The rescue came. She survived the fall.
