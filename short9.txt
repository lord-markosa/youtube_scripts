This is supposably the hardest problem in SAT that you might encounter.
But is it really?

The value of this highlighted expression is given to be 1 over 3. We need to evaluate x.
But since this is repeated infinitely, I can claim that this expression would also be 1 over 3.
Aha!, there we go!

This means square root of x raised to the power one third equals 1 over 3

That means x to the power 1 over 6 is 1 over 3.
Thus x = 1 over 3^6. This would evaluate to 1 over 729.

Hence, its option D.
