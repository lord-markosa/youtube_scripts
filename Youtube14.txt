Given this 4th degree polynomial, we need to solve for x
Now, our usual approach of hit and trial would cause us a lot of trouble.
Instead we are going to observe and find out something special about this polynomial.

If we write down just the coefficients of this polynomial.
We see that it is symmetric about the middle term.

This leads to a special case.
Lets first club the similar coefficients term together. Now let's divide the equation by x^2.

Now if we assume x + 1 over x to be y. Then x^2 + 1 over x^2 + 2 = y^2
Thus, the first part becomes y^2 minus 2 the second part becomes y and the third part is a constant term.

We get a quadratic equation in y.

Hence, solving further we get y = 3 or -5 over 2

Replacing y with x + 1 over x we get two equations

x^2 minus 3x + 1
and 2x^2 + 5x + 2

Solving the first one we get x = 3 plus minus square root 5 over 2
Solving the second one we get x = -1 over 2 and x = -2

Thus we obtain all the 4 roots of the equation without any hardship of hit and trial.

We’re given a fourth-degree polynomial and asked to solve for X.

Now, normally we might try hit and trial — but that would be painful here.

Instead, let’s observe something interesting.

If we just look at the coefficients, we’ll notice they are symmetric around the middle term.

That’s a special case.

Let’s first rearrange the equation to group terms with the same coefficients, and then divide the entire equation by <say-as interpret-as="characters">x</say-as> squared.

We get this nice equation, which some of you might be familiar with.

To solve this, we assume X plus one over X is equal to Y.

Then, X^2 + 1 over X^2 + 2 = Y^2. Rearrange a bit.

Substituting this in the original equation, we get:
2Y^2 minus Y minus 15 = 0

Now that’s just a simple quadratic in <say-as interpret-as="characters">y</say-as>.

Factorizing it, we get <say-as interpret-as="characters">y</say-as> equals 3 or minus five over 2.

Case One, for Y = 3:

We replace Y with X plus one over X.
we get, X^2 minus 3X + 1 = 0.
Using quadratic formula, we get x = 3 plus minus square root 5 over 2,

And for Case 2: Y = minus five over 2, we get:
2x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0.
Factorizing it, we get x = minus one-half, or minus 2.

Thus, the four roots of the polynomial are:
3 plus or minus square root 5 over 2, minus one-half, and minus 2.

So we’ve found all the roots without any hit and trial.
