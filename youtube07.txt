In this problem we are asked to find out the limit of this expression
where this bracket thingy represents the greatest integer function.

To solve this problem we just need to
A. Be aware of limits (that it exists)
B. Know what greatest integer function does

First,
In mathematics, a limit describes the value a function or sequence approaches as its input approaches a certain value.

When an finite valued expression like (sine x over x) reaches some indeterminate form (like 0 over 0), then its possible to resolve its actual value using limits (here it approaches 1).

Second,
The greatest integer function does exactly the same thing as its name suggest, it finds out the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x.

For example take 1.35 the greatest integer less than or equal to 1.35 is nothing but 1, for -1.35 its -2.

Confused? Lets have any number between two integers, using this function we always bring it back to the closest integer.

Now lets take a look at the graph of this function.

Consider the line y = x to map all points on x axis to the same points on y axis.
Lets draw some lines parallel to the x-axis through the integer points on y-axis.

Now take any point on y = x, it always falls to the floor — the horizontal line just below it.
	
So the line y equals x gets piecewise projected onto these lower horizontal steps.

Thus the line y = x gets piecewise projected onto these lower horizontal floor closest to it.

Finally when we do this for all the points we get a graph like this which looks like a staircase. This is why this kind of function is also known as stepwise function.

This green line is actually y = x minus 1 and illustrates how the function is bounded between y = x and y = x minus 1.

Now, we are going to take this result and apply it to our problem.

greatest integer KX is less than or equal to KX and greater than KX-1

Don't get scared by this expression, its nothing but this inequality summed from k = 1 to n just as in the problem statement.

Taking out x common on both the extreme ends of the inequality, we can write the sum of natural numbers from 0 to n as n times (n+1) over 2. Also the minus 1 when summed up from k = 1 to n becomes 1.

Lets divide the obtained expression by n^2.

Then apply the limits.

Now 1 over n (where n is a large number) becomes 0.

Now we can see the limit is sandwiched between the same value that is x over 2

This implies that the limit is nothing but x over 2.

    To solve this problem, we just need to do two things. 
    <break time="300ms"/>
    A — Be aware of limits. 
    <break time="200ms"/>
    B — Know what the greatest integer function does.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    First — in mathematics, a limit describes the value a function or sequence approaches as its input approaches a certain value.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    When a finite-valued expression, like sine x over x, reaches an indeterminate form like zero over zero, 
    it's still possible to find its actual value using limits. 
    <break time="300ms"/>
    In this case, it approaches one.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Second — the greatest integer function does exactly what its name suggests. 
    It finds the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    For example, the greatest integer less than or equal to one point three five is one. 
    For negative one point three five, it’s negative two.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Confused? <break time="200ms"/> Let’s clear it up.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    Take any number between two integers — using this function, we always bring it back to the closest integer below it.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    Now, let’s take a look at the graph of this function.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    Consider the line y equals x, which maps all x values to the same points on the y-axis.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    Now draw lines parallel to the x-axis through the integer points on the y-axis.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    Take any point on the line y equals x — it always drops to the floor, 
    landing on the horizontal line just below it.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    So the line y equals x gets piecewise projected onto these lower horizontal steps.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    When we repeat this for all points, the graph starts to look like a staircase.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    That’s why this function is also known as a stepwise function.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    This green line — y equals x minus 1 — helps illustrate that the function is always bounded between y equals x and y equals x minus 1.

    <break time="600ms"/>

    Now, let’s apply this idea to our problem.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    The greatest integer of k times x is less than or equal to k x, 
    and greater than k x minus 1.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    Don’t get scared by the expression — it’s just this inequality summed from k equals 1 to n, just as in the problem statement.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Taking x common on both ends of the inequality, we can write the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n as n times n plus 1 over 2. 
    And the minus one, when summed from k equals 1 to n, becomes n.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Now, divide the entire expression by n squared, and apply the limits.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    As n becomes very large, one over n tends to zero.

    <break time="300ms"/>

    Now we can see — the entire limit is sandwiched between two values that both approach x over 2.

    <break time="400ms"/>

    This implies that the final answer is simply — <emphasis>x over 2</emphasis>.
