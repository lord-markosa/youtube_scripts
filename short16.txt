90 percent of the time we miss the crucial information that lies straight in front of us.

In this problem we are given the following triangle inscribed in a semicircle and we need to find which of the following angles are 30 degrees.

In triangle OAC, we can see that perpendicular from C bisects the base AO, this implies
that it is an isosceles triangle. which means AC = OC, and x = y

But OC = OA = radius.
This means it is an equilateral triangle.

Thus x = y = 30 degrees.

In triangle OCB, OC = OB = Radius, which means triangle OCB is an isosceles triangle with z = w
Also z + y equals the opposite exterior angle COA which equals 60 degrees.

Thus z = w = 30 degrees.

Hence all of them are 30 degrees.

90% of the time, we miss the obvious thing hiding in the plain sight.

In this problem, a triangle is inscribed in a semicircle, and we’re asked: which angles are 30 degrees?

Let’s look at triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">OAC</say-as>.
The perpendicular from point <say-as interpret-as="characters">C</say-as> bisects base <say-as interpret-as="characters">AO</say-as>, making it isosceles.
So, <say-as interpret-as="characters">AC</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">OC</say-as> which equals the radius, also angle X equals angle Y.

That makes triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">OAC</say-as> equilateral.
So, <say-as interpret-as="characters">x</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">y</say-as> equals 30 degrees.

Now look at triangle <say-as interpret-as="characters">OCB</say-as>.
<say-as interpret-as="characters">OC</say-as> equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">OB</say-as>, so it's isosceles.
That means angle Z equals angle W.

The exterior angle <say-as interpret-as="characters">AOC</say-as> is 60 degrees, which equals Z + W.
Thus, Z = W = 30 degrees.

Hence, all the angles are 30 degrees.

Its option D.
