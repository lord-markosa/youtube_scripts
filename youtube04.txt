the property sum of squares

finding x

We are given a rectangle and some point O inside it such that this line segment is of length 6, this is of length 5, this 8 and this x, which of course we need to find out.

Now lets suppose for any rectangle ABCD, O be a point inside it. Lets drop perpendicular to the sides from O, such that it divides the rectangle into these 4 smaller rectangles. Let w, x, y and z be the length of these perpendiculars.

If we take a look at this yellow triangle, what can we say about the length OD?
Well, we can use Pythagoras theorem and write OD^2 = y^2 + z^2 as OD is the diagonal of the bottom right rectangle.
Similarly for this triangle we can write OA^2 = z^2 + w^2
Then, OB^2 = x^2 + w^2
and OC^2 = y^2 + x^2.

If you look carefully, we can add OB^2 + OD^2 to get the sum of w^2, x^2, y^2, z^2.
Same can be done for OA^2 + OC^2.

This means that OB^2 + OD^2 = OA^2 + OC^2

This relation is going to help us solve the problem. Now we can just put the values in the relation and obtain x^2 = 75.
Thus x is nothing but 5 root 3
