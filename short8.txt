Are you good with percentages?
Lets find out!

Given, the side of a cube is decreased by 20%. We need to find out the percent decrease in its Surface Area.

We just need to know that Surface area is proportional to A^2, where A is the side length of the cube.
The new A = 0.8 times original A.
Thus new A^2 will be equal to 0.64 times original A^2.
decrease percent would be (1-0.64) times 100, since A is going to get cancelled out in percent calculation.
Thus the Surface area would decrease by 36%.

Hence its option B.
