This is a repeated problem of JEE Advanced (world's second toughest exam)
Its given alpha and beta are the roots of this equation.
Wait hold on... what is this expression?

Let me find out the roots of the equation and try to substitute that...
Wait... the roots are complex numbers...
How on earth am I supposed to solve this problem?

Let's try to substitute alpha and beta in this expression.
Then the terms can be rearranged a little to take out terms raised to power 8 common.
Wait... have I seen these somewhere?
Yeah, its the equation. So I can just substitute alpha squared + 10 into the expression as 6 alpha and same for beta.

That's great... the expression simplified... its just 6... that's option B
