Hey Everyone!

The problem you saw in the thumbnail is a really simple one. Its a differential equation but is not in the normal form that we usually encounter. Let's tone it down to what we know by taking natural logarithm on both the sides.

Now we know that in logarithm the power of the argument can come outside of it. 

Thus we can write this expression. Let's rearrange this, Ahhaaa this is something we are familiar with and can be integrated.

Next, we are going to use integration by parts. A little bit on this. It actually comes from the product rule of differentiation. Here u, v are some function of x. We can rearrange this a little bit and integrate both the sides. To get this result. Now we take something easily integrable to be DV.

So Let U = LN x this implies DU = 1 over X times DX.
Let DV = dx this implies V = X (just integrating)

Thus using the by-parts formula we can write:

integration of LN X DX = gives us UV that is X LN X minus integration of X times 1 over X which is nothing but 1.
Thus we get integration of X LN X - X.

Finally we can integrate LN Y in the same manner to get this final expression. Here C is the integration constant.

  Hey everyone!
  
  The problem you saw in the thumbnail might <emphasis level="moderate">look</emphasis> complicated at first glance —
  but it’s actually quite simple once we break it down.

  It’s a differential equation but not in the standard form we’re used to seeing.

  Let’s simplify it by taking the <emphasis level="moderate">natural logarithm</emphasis> on both sides.  
  That’s always a great trick when you see powers involved!

  Now, remember a property of logarithms:  
  When something is raised to a power, that power can come out in front.

  Using that, we rewrite the equation —
  and suddenly it looks much more familiar!

  At this point, it's ready to be integrated.

  But wait — the integral we have now calls for a special technique:  
  <break time="400ms"/>
  <emphasis level="strong">Integration by parts.</emphasis>

  Let’s take a quick detour and recall where this comes from.  
  It actually originates from the <emphasis level="moderate">product rule</emphasis> of differentiation.

  Where <say-as interpret-as="characters">u</say-as> and <say-as interpret-as="characters">v</say-as> are two functions of x.

  We can integrate both sides of this equation and rearrange a little bit to get the <emphasis level="moderate">integration by parts</emphasis> formula.

  Now let’s apply it.

  We choose:
  <break time="300ms"/>
  U equals <say-as interpret-as="characters">l n x</say-as>,  
  which gives us d u equals one over x d x

  d v equals d x  
  which integrates to v equals x

  Plugging everything into the formula:

  The integral of <say-as interpret-as="characters">l n x</say-as> d x is  
  u times v minus the integral of v times d u

  That gives us:  
  x ln x minus the integral of x times one over x  
  which simplifies to just 1

  So, we have:  
  x ln x minus x

  That’s the integral of <say-as interpret-as="characters">l n x</say-as> d x — nice and clean.

  Now, we apply the same logic to integrate <say-as interpret-as="characters">l n y</say-as>,  
  and we arrive at the final expression.

  And don’t forget — we add <emphasis level="moderate">C</emphasis>,  
  the constant of integration, at the end.
